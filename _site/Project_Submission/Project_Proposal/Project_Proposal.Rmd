# 1.0 Introduction / Motivation for the Project

Brazil is currently the largest ecommerce market in Latin America and the 13th largest in the world despite a low internet penetration of 61% suggesting huge potential for growth in the e-commerce landscape.

In 2019, local e-commerce giant Shopee, launched their app in Brazil’s e-tail market, and has become the most downloaded shopping app in Brazil.

Through the use of the [Olist dataset which comprises data from 2016-2018 made at multiple Olist Store marketplaces in Brazil](https://www.kaggle.com/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce), our group aims to:

1. Learn about the E-commerce market/consumers preferences/purchase trends of the Brazilian market
2. Discover Olist’s potential areas of growth and improvement
3. Apply visualisation/analytics techniques to deliver the information

# 2.0 Problems or issues that the project will address

<center>![](images/olist_icon.png){width=40%}</center>


Olist is a Brazilian e-commerce company which aims to be the largest online shopping platform in the Brazilian market. With a large number of products and sales, a clear visualisation and understanding of the sales and trends of different  products and customers are extremely important for future growth.

Besides acting as a platform for product sales, it also does advertisement of products. Hence, the need of understanding different product segments will be critical for their business.

Questions that will be answered in this analysis include:

1. What is the general business trend using data relating to customer activity,, order value and number of orders?
2. What does the data tell us about the potential for sales uplift in the future?

# 3.0 Relevant related work

In the private ecommerce sector where competition is high, data driven strategies are utilised to explore and solve business problems for profits maximisation. Many business analysts have researched different data visualisation/analytics techniques to see how they can be applied to the e-commerce space to deliver business values.

In the“Market Segmentation Analysis and Visualisation Using K-Mode Clustering Algorithm for E-Commerce Business”, Deepali Kamthania, Ashish Pahwa and Srijit S. Madhavan discussed various BI tools and a decision process for market segmentation based on user behaviour analysis and geographical information. Specifically they deployed a clustering technique(K-mean) to customer’s product-click data for segmentation. They also produced many other data visualisations such as a map of geographical distributions of users using geo-coordinates of the visitors as well as interactive time series, bar plots and graphs to answer important business questions such as “which was the most popular product on any given day.”

In the public sector, E-commerce sales on a national level is also a topic in the spotlight. 
In the “A Time-Series Analysis of the U.S. Ecommerce Sales”, researchers D. Steven. White and Godwin C. Ariguzo analysed U.S. ecommerce sales data from the U.S Census bureau using time series analysis. Specifically, they built an autoregressive-moving average model and used it further to examine the residuals to seek an optimised model. In addition, they have also extended the trendline to predict the total U.S. e-commerce sales for 2011,2012, and 2013.

# 4.0 Analysis Approach

Our team aims to analyse the activity and performance of Olist through the following metrics:

1. Gross Merchandise Value (GMV) - derived from the sum of value of purchases made in a given observation window
2. Number of orders
3. Number of customers

The table below summarizes the key plots and visualisation techniques proposed:

| S/N        | Data / Graph Type          | Techniques  | Objective  
|:--- |:-------------------------------|:----------------------------------|:--------------------------------|
|1 |**Gross Merchandise Value** (based on the sum of Total Order Value - Month on Month) - Aggregated and by product categories |Time-series, Horizon graph (for trending across categories), Barplot |To observe any  trends in terms of seasonality, or potential for sales uplift|
|2 |**Number of orders** (Month-on-Month) - Aggregated and by product categories|Time-series, Horizon graph, Barplot|To observe any  trends in terms of seasonality, or potential for sales uplift|
|3 |**Number of customers** (Month-on-Month) - Aggregated and by product categories|Time-series, Horizon graph, Barplot|To observe any  trends in terms of seasonality, or potential for sales uplift|
|4 |**Number of customers/orders/GMV** by the greater Sao Paolo administrative boundary - Area to be derived using the *geobr* R package|Geovisual Analytics (Chloroploth map)|To understand from a geographical perspective where customer order activity is the highest |
|5 |**Sales Regression**(monthly)|Multiple linear regression model using lm() of Base Stats of R |To understand where the business is headed in the immediate future|
|6 |**Correlation Analysis**(between product categories)|Using corrplot() |To understand any relationship between different products to see if there is potential to bundle certain products |
|7 |**Heatmap**| |Heatmap comparison of product category split by region|
|8 |**Funnel Plot**| |Heatmap comparison of product category split by region|
|9 |**ARIMA modelling (monthly/6-monthly) forecast**| [Using the forecast R package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/forecast/forecast.pdf) |To do a 6 month forecast of customer acquisition/orders/total turnover|

## 4.1 Dataset

The dataset was obtained from Kaggle (Brazillian E-Commerce Public Dataset by Olist) accessed through this [link](https://www.kaggle.com/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce). The dataset has information of 100k orders from 2016 to 2018 made at multiple marketplaces in Brazil.

For the current project scope, we will be using the following datasets provided and transforming it accordingly to suit our use case.

The table below illustrates the specific datasets which will be used:

| S/N        |Name         | Description  |
|:--- |:-------------------------------|:----------------------------------|
|1 |Olist_oder_customer_dataset.csv|Customer level data|
|2 |Olist_orders_dataset.csv|Order information|
|3 |Olist_order_payments_dataset.csv|Order value|
|4 |Olist_order_items_dataset.csv|Information on the exact type of items in each order|
|5 |Olist_products_dataset.csv|Map categories to each product|


## 4.2 Proposed packages to be used


## 4.3 Project Timeline

| S/N        |Name         | Description  |
|:--- |:-------------------------------|:----------------------------------|
|1 |Olist_oder_customer_dataset.csv|Customer level data|
|2 |Olist_orders_dataset.csv|Order information|

# 5.0 Early Prototypes

Our team has come up with an initial wireframe/protype of the Shiny app which is broken down into 3 sections (Overview, Geospatial Analysis, Sales Analysis) to provide the user with a holistic understanding of the performance and trends in terms of customer behaviour, sales and orders. The images below illustrated in greater detail what we hope to create in the final application.
